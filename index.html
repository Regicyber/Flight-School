                    <p class="lead">Epic Flight Academyâ€™s Airline Pilot Program provides international students with step-by-step structured flight training. This will take you from someone with zero flight experience to a commercial pilot career in as little as one
                        year. Also, transfer students are able to convert their prior flight training. Our programs meet the requirements of all Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Furthermore, our programs
                        support students who may speak English as a second language. Anyone who pursues a career as a professional pilot, whether in the United States or in their home countries, must speak English. In the aviation industry, the ability
                        to speak English proficiently is required of all pilots. If you have already had some flight training, you can convert your training through Foreign Pilot License Verification. Most importantly, if needed, financing options may
                        be available.</p>
